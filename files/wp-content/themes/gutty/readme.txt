== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What steps should I do when moving from an existing site using FSE =

- Clear templates & templates-parts
When launching Gutty for the 1st time or when moving away from an existing site FSE based, please make sure that you flush templates and template-parts customization. Go to `Appearance> Editor > Templates > Manage all templates`. Next to each template/template part showing `Customized`, hit the 3 dots and `click Clear customizations`.

- Clear saved styles
If you are using Gutty on a website where FSE has already been configured, you will need to reset styles to default. To do so go to `Appearance> Editor > Styles` and click the pencil icon (`Edit styles`). Next, in the sidebar, click the clock icon (`Revisions`) and click `Reset to defaults`. Don't forget to save.
